## Hate Speech Detection Using Deep Learning

#### Author: Abhay Rajendra Dixit

#### Datasets
- [Waseem and Hovy](https://github.com/ZeerakW/hatespeech)
- [Davidson et. al.](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language) 
- The datasets have been programmatically combined to have tweets with labeled as 0, 1, 2.
- 0 - Hateful, 1 - Offensive, 2 - Neutral
- The program used to combine the datasets is not provided here


#### To train the LSTM model
- Upload the HateSpeechDetection folder in Google Drive
- Open the HateSpeechDetection.ipynb file
- Change the path of the files under "File Paths" section
- Run all the cells until "Load Model"

#### To test the LSTM model
- Run all the cells under the "Test Model" section

#### To run baseline models 
- Run all the cells from "Baseline Models"


####Note: 
- The Python notebook was tested on Google Colaboratory. Running it on jupyter notebook might require installation of additional libraries
- Please run all cells in a sequential order to avoid errors
